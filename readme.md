## Contributing

Pull requests should aim to `develop`. You're free to open issues to suggest changes. If you want to work on a hard feature i'd recommend you to join slack to be sure we are all on the same page.

## Slack

I'm setting up a slack auto inviter for this project. Meanwhile, if you want to join us you should communicate it on timongo's global chat.
